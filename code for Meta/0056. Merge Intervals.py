56. Merge Intervals
Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals,
and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

"""
Time complexity : O(nlogn)
Other than the sort invocation, we do a simple linear scan of the list, so the runtime is dominated by the O(nlogn) complexity of sorting.

Space complexity : O(logN) (or O(n))
If we can sort intervals in place, we do not need more than constant additional space, although the sorting itself takes O(logn) space. 
Otherwise, we must allocate linear space to store a copy of intervals and sort that.
