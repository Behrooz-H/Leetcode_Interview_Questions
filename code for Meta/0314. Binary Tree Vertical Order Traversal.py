0314. Binary Tree Vertical Order Traversal
Given the root of a binary tree, return the vertical order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from top to bottom, column by column).

If two nodes are in the same row and column, the order should be from left to right.

"""  Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree.
Following the same analysis in the previous BFS approach, the only difference is that this time we don't need the costy 
sorting operation (i.e. O(NlogN)).
Space Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree. The analysis follows the same logic as in the previous BFS approach."""
