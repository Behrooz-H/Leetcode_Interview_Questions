"""669. Trim a Binary Search Tree
Given the root of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as low and high, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in [low, high]. 
Trimming the tree should not change the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant).
It can be proven that there is a unique answer.

Return the root of the trimmed binary search tree. Note that the root may change depending on the given bounds."""

Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the total number of nodes in the given tree. We visit each node at most once.
Space Complexity: O(N). Even though we don't explicitly use any additional memory, the call stack of our recursion could be as large as the number of nodes in the worst case."""
