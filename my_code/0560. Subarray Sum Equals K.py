"""
560. Subarray Sum Equals K
Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the total number of subarrays whose sum equals to k.
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

"""
Time complexity : O(n). The entire nums array is traversed only once.
Space complexity : O(1). Hashmap map can contain up to n distinct entries in the worst case.

# The idea behind this approach is as follows: 
#     If the cumulative sum(represented by sum[i] for sum up to i th
#   index) up to two indices is the same, the sum of the elements lying in between those indices is zero. 
# Extending the same thought further, if the cumulative sum up to two indices, say i and j is at a difference of k i.e.
# if sum[i]âˆ’sum[j]=k, the sum of elements lying between indices i and j is k.
