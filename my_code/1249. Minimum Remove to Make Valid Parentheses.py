"""

Given a string s of '(' , ')' and lowercase English characters.

Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses ( '(' or ')', in any positions ) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid and return any valid string.

Formally, a parentheses string is valid if and only if:

It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.


Example 1:

Input: s = "lee(t(c)o)de)"
Output: "lee(t(c)o)de"
Explanation: "lee(t(co)de)" , "lee(t(c)ode)" would also be accepted.
Example 2:

Input: s = "a)b(c)d"
Output: "ab(c)d"
Example 3:

Input: s = "))(("
Output: ""
Explanation: An empty string is also valid.

"""
Time complexity : O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
Same as the above approaches. We have 2 loops that are looping through up to n characters, doing an O(1) operation on each. 
We also have some O(n) library function calls outside of the loops.


Space complexity : O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
Like the previous approach, the string building requires O(n) space.
