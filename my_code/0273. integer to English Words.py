Let K be the number of pairs in numberToWordsMap and N be the number.
Time complexity: O(K)
The time complexity is O(K) because the loop iterates through the pairs until it finds a match. This complexity is linear with respect to the number of pairs, which is constant in practice as the number of pairs is fixed.

Space complexity: O(log 10â€‹ N)
O(log 10 N), mainly due to the recursion stack in the convert function. The space used is proportional to the number of recursive calls made.

Let N be the number.
Time complexity: O(log 10 N)
O(log10 N), because the number is divided by 1000 in each iteration, making the number of iterations proportional to the number of chunks, which is logarithmic.

Space complexity: O(1)
O(1), constant space. The space used is independent of the number's size, as it involves only a few string builders and arrays.
