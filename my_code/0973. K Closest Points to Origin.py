    973. K Closest Points to Origin
Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

Time complexity: O(N).
Similar to the earlier binary search solution, the QuickSelect solution has a worst-case time complexity of O(N^2 ) if the worst pivot is chosen each time.
On average, however, it has a time complexity of O(N) because it halves (roughly) the remaining elements needing to be processed at each iteration.
2N total processes, yielding an average time complexity of O(N).


Space complexity: O(1).
The QuickSelect algorithm conducts the partial sort of points in place with no recursion, so only constant extra space is required.
